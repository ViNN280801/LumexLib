/**
 * @file XmlTreeWalker.hpp
 * @brief `XmlTreeWalker`, the callback interface of the depth-first traversal
 * performed by `XmlNode::traverse`.
 * @details A walker derives from this class and implements `for_each`, which
 * is called for every descendant of the node being traversed in document
 * order. `begin` and `end` are called once with that node, before and after
 * the descendants. Returning `false` from `begin` or `for_each` stops the walk
 * and makes `traverse` return `false`; otherwise it returns what `end`
 * returns. During `for_each`, `depth()` is the depth of the visited node below
 * the traversed one, 0 for its children.
