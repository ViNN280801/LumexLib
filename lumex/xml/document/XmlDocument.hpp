/**
 * @file XmlDocument.hpp
 * @brief `XmlDocument`, the owner of an XML tree: loading from files, streams,
 * strings and memory buffers, and saving.
 * @details An `XmlDocument` is the document node of its tree and owns all of
 * the tree's memory. Every `XmlNode`, `XmlAttribute` and `XmlText` obtained
 * from it is valid only until the document is destroyed, reset or loaded
 * again. A document can be moved but not copied; `reset(proto)` makes a deep
 * copy of another one.
 *
 * Each load function first resets the document, then parses with the given
 * `kparse_*` options (`XmlConstants.hpp`) and source encoding (`encoding_auto`
 * detects it) and reports the outcome in an `xml_parse_result_t`. The buffer
 * variants differ in ownership: `load_buffer` copies the input,
 * `load_buffer_inplace` parses the caller's buffer, which must then outlive
 * the document, and `load_buffer_inplace_own` also takes it over. Saving
 * writes to an `IXmlWriter`, a narrow or wide output stream, or a file, with
 * an indentation string, `kformat_*` flags and a target encoding. Consumers
 * include the file through `lumex/xml/LumexXml`.
