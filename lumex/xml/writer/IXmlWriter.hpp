/**
 * @file IXmlWriter.hpp
 * @brief `IXmlWriter`, the output interface that XML serialization writes
 * bytes to.
 * @details The interface has one pure virtual function, `write(data, size)`.
 * `XmlDocument::save` and `XmlNode::print` encode and buffer their output and
 * pass it to the writer in blocks of bytes in the target encoding. Implement
 * it to send XML to any destination; the library provides `XmlWriterFile` and
 * `XmlWriterStream`. Consumers include the file through `lumex/xml/LumexXml`.
