/**
 * @file XmlWriterFile.hpp
 * @brief `XmlWriterFile`, an `IXmlWriter` that writes to a C `FILE` stream
 * opened by the caller.
 * @details The constructor takes the stream as a `void` pointer, which must be
 * a `FILE` pointer, and `write` passes each block to `fwrite`. The writer does
 * not open, flush or close the stream. `XmlDocument::save_file` uses it. The
 * class can be neither copied nor moved. Consumers include the file through
 * `lumex/xml/LumexXml`.
