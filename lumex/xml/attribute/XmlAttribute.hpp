/**
 * @file XmlAttribute.hpp
 * @brief `XmlAttribute`, the handle to one attribute of an element: read its
 * name and value, convert the value to numbers and booleans, and change both.
 * @details An `XmlAttribute` is one pointer into the tree of an `XmlDocument`.
 * Copying it copies the handle, not the attribute, and the handle dangles once
 * the document is destroyed, reset or loaded again. An empty handle is safe to
 * use: getters return empty strings or the given defaults and setters return
 * `false`. Attributes are obtained from `XmlNode` (`attribute`,
 * `first_attribute`, `append_attribute` and the attribute iterators declared
 * in `XmlNode.hpp`).
 *
 * The `string_view_t` overloads (`std::basic_string_view<char_t>` from C++17,
 * the `lumex_string_view` of `lumex::string_view` below) exist in every C++
 * standard. They are inline wrappers over the exported pointer-and-size
 * functions, so the library binary does not depend on the standard of its
 * consumer. The class is not exported, so those wrappers are not
 * `dllimport`. The file also declares the logical AND and OR operators with a
 * `bool` and `utility::is_attribute_of`. Consumers include it through
 * `lumex/xml/LumexXml`.
