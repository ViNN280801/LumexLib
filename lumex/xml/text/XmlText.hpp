/**
 * @file XmlText.hpp
 * @brief `XmlText`, typed access to the text content of a node.
 * @details `XmlNode::text()` returns an `XmlText` for an element or a text
 * node. It reads the node's first PCDATA or CDATA child, or the element's own
 * value when the document was parsed with `kparse_embed_pcdata`, and converts
 * it to numbers or a boolean; the given default is returned only when there is
 * no text. Setting a value creates a PCDATA child when there is none. The
 * handle does not own the text and is valid as long as the document.
 *
 * The `string_view_t` overloads (`std::basic_string_view<char_t>` from C++17,
 * the `lumex_string_view` of `lumex::string_view` below) exist in every C++
 * standard. They are inline wrappers and are not `dllimport`, because the
 * class itself is not exported. The file also declares the logical AND and OR
 * operators with a `bool`. Consumers include it through `lumex/xml/LumexXml`.
