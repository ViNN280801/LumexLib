/**
 * @file XPathStack.hpp
 * @brief The memory an XPath evaluation runs on: `XPathStack`, a pair of
 * allocators, and `XPathStackData`, which owns them.
 * @details The `result` allocator holds the values a subexpression returns to
 * its caller, and the `temp` allocator holds intermediate data that is dropped
 * when the subexpression finishes. `XPathStackData` embeds the first block of
 * each, frees the others on destruction and records an allocation failure in
 * `oom`. Each `XPathQuery` evaluation creates its own `XPathStackData` on the
 * stack. The file is internal to the XPath engine.

 * member, and `oom` flag are public for direct access, which deviates from
 *          strict encapsulation but is typical in high-performance memory
 * management components where direct access is needed for efficiency.
