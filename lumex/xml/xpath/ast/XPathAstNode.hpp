/**
 * @file XPathAstNode.hpp
 * @brief `XPathAstNode`, the node of a compiled XPath expression tree, which
 * evaluates itself against a context.
 * @details `XPathParser` builds a tree of these nodes in the `XPathAllocator`
 * of a query. A node holds its `ast_type_t`, its result type, the axis and
 * node test of a location step, links to its operands and a constant, a
 * variable or other data. The `eval_boolean`, `eval_number`, `eval_string` and
 * `eval_node_set` members implement XPath 1.0: operators, the core function
 * library, location steps along every `axis_t` axis, and predicates.
 * `optimize` rewrites the tree once after parsing, for example into a
 * precomputed `translate` table or a direct attribute comparison.
 *
 * The step templates and `axis_to_type` live in the header because the
 * evaluation is instantiated per axis. The file is internal; consumers compile
 * and evaluate expressions with `XPathQuery`.
