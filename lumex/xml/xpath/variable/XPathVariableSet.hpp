/**
 * @file XPathVariableSet.hpp
 * @brief `XPathVariableSet`, the named variables an XPath expression can refer
 * to, and the lookup helper the parser uses.
 * @details The set owns its variables and finds them by name in a hash table
 * of 64 chained buckets; copying it copies every variable. `add` creates a
 * variable or returns the existing one of the same type, and `set` changes the
 * value of an existing variable of the matching type. The parser binds
 * variable references to the variables of the set when a query is compiled, so
 * every referenced variable must be added before compiling, and the set must
 * outlive the query. A value changed afterwards is seen by the next
 * evaluation.
 *
 * `get_variable_scratch` looks up a name that is not terminated, copying it
 * into a scratch buffer first. Consumers include the file through
 * `lumex/xml/LumexXml`.

 * @brief Manages a collection of XPath variables.

 *          a hash-table-like approach with an array of linked lists (`_data`)
 *          to store variables, enabling efficient lookups.
 *
 * @note The `XPathVariableSet` is responsible for the lifetime of the
 * `XPathVariable` objects it contains, allocating and deallocating them as
 * needed. It is designed with value semantics (copy and move
 * constructors/assignments) to allow easy passing and management.
 * @warning The maximum number of variables is fixed by `_max_variables`.
 * Adding more variables than this limit will not cause a crash but will lead
 * to collisions and performance degradation without increasing storage.
