/**
 * @file XPathVariable.hpp
 * @brief `XPathVariable`, a named and typed XPath variable, its four concrete
 * kinds, and the functions that create, copy and destroy them.
 * @details A variable has a fixed `xpath_value_type`: a getter of another type
 * returns a default value, and a setter of another type fails and returns
 * `false`; nothing is converted. The concrete structs
 * `xpath_variable_boolean`, `xpath_variable_number`, `xpath_variable_string`
 * and `xpath_variable_node_set` store the name inline after the object, so
 * `new_xpath_variable` allocates them with `malloc` and
 * `delete_xpath_variable` must release them.
 *
 * Variables are normally created through `XPathVariableSet::add`, and an
 * expression refers to a variable as `$name`. Consumers include the file
 * through `lumex/xml/LumexXml`.
