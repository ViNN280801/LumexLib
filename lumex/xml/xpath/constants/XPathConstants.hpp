 * @brief Size limits and alignment of the XPath engine.
 * @details `kxpath_memory_page_size` (4096) is the data size of an
 * `XPathMemoryBlock`, `kxpath_ast_depth_limit` (1024) the deepest recursion
 * `XPathParser` accepts before it reports an error, and
 * `kxpath_memory_block_alignment` the alignment of every XPath allocation, the
 * larger of the alignments needed for a `double` and a pointer. The constants
 * are in `lumex::xml::xpath::constants::Constants`.
