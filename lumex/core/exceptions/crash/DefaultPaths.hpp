/**
 * @file DefaultPaths.hpp
 * @brief Default names used by the crash handling of `lumex::exceptions`: the
 * crash directory and the file name prefixes.
 * @details `KDEFAULT_CRASHES_DIR_PATH` ("crashes") is the directory next to
 * the executable that `lumex_base_exception::to_crash_report()` writes to on
 * every platform and that `lumex_crash_handler` writes dumps to on Windows.
 * `KDEFAULT_MINIDUMP_PREFIX` ("dump_") starts the name of a dump file, and
 * `KDEFAULT_CRASH_REPORT_PREFIX` ("crash_report_") the name of a crash report.
 * The constants are declared at global scope.
