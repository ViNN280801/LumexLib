/**
 * @file LumexBitLock.hpp
 * @brief A lock held in one 32-bit word: one bit marks it as taken, a second
 * bit records that a thread sleeps on it.
 * @details This is the spin lock of the lock-based `atomic_shared_ptr` and
 * `atomic_weak_ptr`, ported from the lock-based method of the author's own
 * libc++ implementation of `std::atomic<std::shared_ptr<T>>` (P0718R2,
 * llvm-project pull request 194215; that implementation also has a lock-free
 * method, which is not ported). One change: libc++ can keep the two bits in
 * the low bits of its own control block pointer, while this library works
 * over the `std::shared_ptr` of any standard library, whose layout it must
 * not touch, so the bits live in a word of their own.
 *
 * A thread that finds the lock taken spins briefly (12 pause instructions,
 * then 4 yields, the spin policy of libstdc++'s `std::atomic::wait`), then
 * sets the sleeper bit and sleeps until the word changes. The spin is this
 * port's addition: the libc++ method parks at once in libc++'s global wait
 * table, while sleeping on the wait table of a C++11 build costs a mutex and
 * a condition variable. The unlocking thread clears both bits in one
 * exchange and, if the sleeper bit was set, wakes every sleeper. The woken
 * threads race for the lock again; a thread that loses sets the sleeper bit
 * again before it goes back to sleep. Sleeping without setting the bit again
 * is the lost wake-up that the libc++ pull request had to fix: the next unlock
 * would see no sleeper bit and wake nobody.
 *
 * The protected sections of the atomic smart pointers only move or copy a
 * smart pointer, so the lock is held briefly; sleeping matters when the
 * holder is preempted.
 *
 * Under ThreadSanitizer the lock is annotated as a mutex, so the sanitizer
 * orders the protected accesses through the lock and can report lock order
 * inversions that involve it.
 *
 * Everything here is an implementation detail of `lumex/core/atomic`.
