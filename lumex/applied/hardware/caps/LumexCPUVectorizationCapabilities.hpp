 * @brief Run-time detection of the SIMD instruction sets that the processor
 * and the operating system support.
 * @details Declares `cpu_vectorization_info_t`, which holds one flag per
 * instruction set (SSE to SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, five AVX-512 subsets, FMA3, FMA4,
 * NEON, SVE), the widest usable SIMD register in bits and a readable summary,
 * and `CPUVectorizationDetector`, which fills it. On x86 and x64 the detector
 * reads CPUID and reports AVX and the later sets only when the operating
 * system saves the extended register state (XSAVE); on ARM Linux it reads the
 * hardware capability words of the auxiliary vector (`getauxval`). Nothing is
 * cached: every `detect()` call queries the processor again. The
 * implementation is compiled into the `lumex::hardware` library.
