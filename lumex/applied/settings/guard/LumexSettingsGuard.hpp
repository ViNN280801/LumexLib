/**
 * @brief Format-agnostic backup/repair/validation guard for an
 * `ILumexSettings` instance.
 * @details Adds three behaviors on top of any settings file, working through
 * `ILumexSettings` alone:
 *            - `ensure_exists_with_defaults` / `repair_if_corrupted`: if the
 * guarded file is missing or fails to `load()`, back it up (when it exists)
 * and regenerate it via a caller-supplied `LumexSettingsCreateFn`, then
 * re-validate.
 *            - `backup`: a static, format-independent file-level copy to
 *              `<filename>.bak.<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`, implemented purely against
 *              `lumex::filesystem`/`lumex::path` (no dependency on any
 * concrete `ILumexSettings` implementation).
 *            - `ensure_keys_with_defaults`: walks a list of
 * `lumex_settings_key_spec_t` and restores each key's default value whenever
 * it is missing, empty, or fails its own `validate` callback. The class owns
 * no settings storage itself - it composes an existing
 *          `std::shared_ptr<ILumexSettings>` (INI, JSON, XML or any other
 * implementation of the interface) plus the filesystem path that instance
 * loads from and saves to.
 * @note Thread-safety: an internal `std::recursive_mutex` serializes
 * concurrent calls made through the *same* `LumexSettingsGuard` instance, not
 * every access to the file in the process, by design: a `LumexSettingsGuard`
 * composes a caller-owned `ILumexSettings` instance rather than a global
 * file-access chokepoint.
 * If the same underlying file is also touched by other `ILumexSettings`
 * instances, other `LumexSettingsGuard`s, or unrelated code, callers remain
 * responsible for their own synchronization, as with any `ILumexSettings`
 * instance.
 * @note Exception safety: every public member function is `noexcept`.
 * Exceptions raised by a caller-supplied
 * `LumexSettingsValidateFn`/`LumexSettingsCreateFn` are caught and treated as
 * failure (validation rejected / default-creation failed), and `backup()`
 * catches everything. An exception from the guarded `ILumexSettings` itself
 * (its `load()`, `get()`, `add()` or `save()`; `LumexSettingsJSON::save()`
 * throws for a value that is not valid UTF-8) ends the call: it is logged
 * with its `what()` message and the call returns `false`. Values already
 * changed in memory before the exception stay changed.
