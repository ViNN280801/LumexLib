/**
 * @file LumexSettingsJSON.hpp
 * @brief `ILumexSettings` over JSON files, parsed and written with the
 * vendored nlohmann/json.
 * @details Declares `LumexSettingsJSON` and its `Constants` (the `.json`
 * extension and `settings`, the implicit section of the scalar members of the
 * root object). A section is a JSON object and a key is one of its scalar
 * members. Without `LUMEX_SETTINGS_WITH_JSON` (the nlohmann/json header absent
 * at build time) the class still compiles, but loading, saving and validation
 * fail.

/**
 * @class LumexSettingsJSON
 * @brief A lightweight, C++11-based JSON settings manager.
 *
 * Implements `ILumexSettings` with the same section/key/value contract as
 * `LumexSettingsINI` and `LumexSettingsXML`. Parsing and writing go through
 * vendored nlohmann/json only.
 *
 * Load mapping:
 * - The document must be a JSON object.
 * - If any value is an object, those keys are sections and their scalar
 *   children are keys. Scalar children of the root itself are stored under
 *   the implicit section `settings`.
 * - Otherwise the root is a single section named `settings` (flat
 *   `{ "LEVEL": "DEBUG" }`). Nested `{ "logger": { "LEVEL": "DEBUG" } }`
 *   loads as section `logger`.
 *
 * Save always writes an object of objects:
 * `{ "section": { "key": "value" } }`.
 *
 * When `LUMEX_SETTINGS_WITH_JSON` is not defined (nlohmann header not
 * present), `load` / `save` / `is_json_valid` return false. The factory
 * then returns nullptr for `LumexSettingsExtensions::JSON`.
 *
 * @note This class is not designed to be thread-safe for concurrent writes.
 *       External synchronization is required if instances are shared across
 * threads.
