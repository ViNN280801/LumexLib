/**

 * library's own `lumex::xml` module.
 * @details Declares `LumexSettingsXML` and its `Constants` (the `.xml`
 * extension and `settings`, the root element that saving writes). A section is
 * a child element of the root and a key is a leaf element inside it. Without
 * `LUMEX_SETTINGS_WITH_XML` (the XML module not built) the class still
 * compiles, but loading, saving and validation fail.

 * @class LumexSettingsXML
 * @brief A lightweight, C++11-based XML settings manager.
 *
 * Implements `ILumexSettings` with the same section/key/value contract as
 * `LumexSettingsINI`. Parsing and writing go through `LumexXml` only; this
 * class does not vendor a second XML library.
 *
 * Load mapping:
 * - Any well-formed document with a root element is accepted.
 * - If any child of the root has an element child, those children are
 *   sections and their leaf children are keys. Leaf children of the root
 *   itself are stored under a section named after the root.
 * - Otherwise the root is a single section (logger-style
 *   `<logger><LEVEL>DEBUG</LEVEL></logger>`).
 *
 * Save always writes the canonical shape
 * `<settings><section><key>value</key></section></settings>`.
 *
 * When `LUMEX_SETTINGS_WITH_XML` is not defined (XML module not built),
 * `load` / `save` / `is_xml_valid` return false. The factory then returns
 * nullptr for `LumexSettingsExtensions::XML`.
 *
 * @note This class is not designed to be thread-safe for concurrent writes.
 *       External synchronization is required if instances are shared across
 * threads.
