 * decides whether to start it at all, and with what poll interval, purely

/**
 * @class LumexResourceMonitor
 * @brief Starts/stops a background thread that periodically samples total CPU
 * and RAM usage and appends one formatted line per sample to a dedicated log
 * file.
 *
 * @details On Windows, CPU usage is sampled via `GetSystemTimes` and RAM via
 * `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`; on Linux, CPU usage comes from `/proc/stat` and RAM
 * from `sysinfo`. Both platforms use the same delta-based CPU percentage
 * calculation (idle-time delta vs. total-time delta between two consecutive
 * samples). The sampler is a process-wide singleton: only one background
 * thread can run at a time, started and stopped through the static methods
 *          below.
 *
 * @note All methods are static and thread-safe.
 *
 * @par Example
 * @code
 * // Host application decides whether to enable it and at what interval - the
 * library does not. if (hostConfig.resourceLoggingEnabled)
 * {
 *   lumex::applied::resource_monitor::monitor::LumexResourceMonitor::startIfEnabled(
 *     hostConfig.logDirectory, hostConfig.resourceLogPollInterval);
 * }
 * // ... later, at shutdown:
 * lumex::applied::resource_monitor::monitor::LumexResourceMonitor::stop();
 * @endcode
