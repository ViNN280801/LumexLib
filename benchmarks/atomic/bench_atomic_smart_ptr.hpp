/**
 * @file bench_atomic_smart_ptr.hpp
 * @brief Measurement core of LumexAtomicBenchmark.
 *
 * The benchmark compares atomic shared pointers that cannot share one
 * translation unit: LumexLib's lock-based engine built at C++11 (sleeping on
 * the striped wait table) and at C++20 (sleeping in std::atomic::wait),
 * LumexLib's lock-free engine at C++11 and C++20 (the replaced value
 * destroyed immediately, and deferred), the common name at C++20, the
 * wrapper of the standard library's type, the standard library's
 * std::atomic<std::shared_ptr<T>> and, where Boost is found, its
 * boost::atomic_shared_ptr (a spinlock). Each unit instantiates the
 * templates below for its own type and hands main () an implementation_t:
 * plain data and a function pointer, so units built with different standards
 * meet only through types that mean the same in every standard. An engine
 * that a build does not have is handed over as an implementation_t with a
 * null `measure`, and main () leaves it out.
 *
 * The method is the one the author used for the libc++ implementation of
 * llvm-project pull request 194215: N threads run one operation on one
 * shared object for a fixed time, and every result is divided by
 * std::atomic<std::uint64_t>::compare_exchange_strong timed in the same
 * process, at the same thread count, right before.
